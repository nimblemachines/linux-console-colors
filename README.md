# linux-console-colors
Two simple programs to read and write the color palette used by the Linux console, and an example bit of code - suitable for inclusion in .profile or .bash_login - with some not totally terrible colors.

It's not Solarized, but then I'm not sure I entirely understand (or agree with) Solarized.

But the defaults are so truly terrible that I had to do *something*.
