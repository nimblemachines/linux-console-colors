# linux-console-colors
Two simple programs to read and write the color palette used by the Linux console, and an example bit of code - suitable for inclusion in .profile or .bash_login - with some not totally terrible colors.

It's not [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), but the console defaults are so truly terrible that I had to do *something*.

I'm not sure I entirely understand (or agree with) Solarized. However, if you want to try it, you can try sourcing `solarized.sh`, which I've included.
